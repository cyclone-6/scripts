Cyclone-6's Misc (And Probably Mostly Useless) Scripts For Linux Systems

deck_shuffle.sh:

Bash script that shuffles a deck of cards (with, or without, jokers) and
deals out a given number of 5 card hands and displays them with unicode
characters representing the four card suits.

inst_discord.sh:

Bash script to make it easier to install the constant updates (almost)
every time I launch Discord on Linux. Requires that the download
location variable be set and then searchs for the latest .deb file
version and installs it.

javaarray.sh:

Bash script that searches a directory containing multiple directories
each with a separate version of Java and allows a secltion of avilable
versions to launch a specific .jar file. Developed to make it easier to
launch certain game servers and IDEs that were version picky.

metars.sh:

Bash script that given a particular ICAO location code, retrieves latest
raw METARS data.

wizzodice.sh:

Bash script that rolls a number of polyhedral dice and displays the rolls,
the sum of each roll by die type and the sum of all the die type. Die rolls
allow for modifers (ie 4d6+2), developed to help in TTRPG and strategic
wargames.
